# React Router (basics and beyond)

You should be able to:
- Use the URL bar to manage state and control navigation within a SPA using the `react-router-dom` library
- Set up BrowserRouter in a parent component to handle routing
- Swap views using Route components
- Navigate to specific routes using Link components
