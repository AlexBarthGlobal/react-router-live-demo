# React Router (basics and beyond)

## Quickstart

Chose the branch you want to clone - the final project is under the branch `final`
- start point: project with no routing
- step 1: project with `BrowserRouter`, `Switch` and `Route`
- step 2: `Link` and `NavLink` added
- step 3: route props: `history`, `location`, `params`

```bash
git clone
cd react-router-live-demo
npm install
npm run start
```
