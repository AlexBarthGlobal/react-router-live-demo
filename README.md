# React Router (basics and beyond)

You should be able to:
- Use the URL bar to manage state and control navigation within a SPA using the `react-router-dom` library
- Set up BrowserRouter in a parent component to handle routing
- Swap views using Route components
- Navigate to specific routes using Link components

## Quickstart

Chose the branch you want to clone - the final project is under the branch `final`
- start point: project with no routing
- step 1: project with `BrowserRouter`, `Switch` and `Route`
- step 2: `Link` and `NavLink` added
- step 3: route props: `history`, `location`, `params`

```bash
git clone
cd react-router-live-demo
npm install
npm run start
```
